#### Task4: Comments and Reflections

1.  Using LaTex is kinda of confusing, which is not mentioned in our classes.
2.  How to insert an image into Rmarkdown is pretty easy.
3.  Yes. It's my first time to use R markdown. Compared to other coding languages, R is relatively quick to pick up, even though I spent quite a time figuring out the rules.
4.  Yes. With the help of my friend majoring in Computer Science, I finished my HW.
5.  5 Hours
6.  It should be Part3 Quadratic Equation.
